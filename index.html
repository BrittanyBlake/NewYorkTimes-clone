        CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young physicist
        named Alan Guth, with a new son and a year’s appointment at Stanford,
        stayed up late with his notebook and equations, venturing far beyond the
        world of known physics.
      </p>
      <p>
        He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic
        particles that should have been created in the Big Bang. Instead he
        discovered what might have made the universe bang to begin with. A
        potential hitch in the presumed course of cosmic evolution could have
        infused space itself with a special energy that exerted a repulsive
        force, causing the universe to swell faster than the speed of light for
        a prodigiously violent instant.
      </p>
      <p>
        If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why the
        heavens look uniform from pole to pole and not like a jagged, warped
        mess. The enormous ballooning would iron out all the wrinkles and
        irregularities. Those particles were not missing, but would be diluted
        beyond detection, like spit in the ocean.
      </p>
      <p>
        “SPECTACULAR REALIZATION,” Dr. Guth wrote across the top of the page and
        drew a double box around it.
      </p>
      <p>
        On Monday, Dr. Guth’s starship came in. Radio astronomers reported that
        they had seen the beginning of the Big Bang, and that his hypothesis,
        known undramatically as inflation, looked right.<br />

        Reaching back across 13.8 billion years to
        <a href="#">the first sliver of cosmic time</a> with telescopes at the
        South Pole, a team of astronomers led by John M. Kovac of the
        Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics detected ripples in the
        fabric of space-time — so-called <a>gravitational waves</a> — the
        signature of a universe being wrenched violently apart when it was
        roughly a trillionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a second old.
        They are the long-sought smoking-gun evidence of inflation, proof, Dr.
        Kovac and his colleagues say, that Dr. Guth was correct.

      <p>
        Inflation has been the workhorse of cosmology for 35 years, though many,
        including Dr. Guth, wondered whether it could ever be proved.<br />

        If corroborated, Dr. Kovac’s work will stand as a landmark in science
        comparable to the recent discovery of dark energy pushing the universe
        apart, or of the Big Bang itself. It would open vast realms of time and
        space and energy to science and speculation.<br />

        Confirming inflation would mean that the universe we see, extending 14
        billion light-years in space with its hundreds of billions of galaxies,
        is only an infinitesimal patch in a larger cosmos whose extent,
        architecture and fate are unknowable. Moreover, beyond our own universe
        there might be an endless number of other universes bubbling into frothy
        eternity, like a pot of pasta water boiling over.
      </p>
      <h3>‘As Big as It Gets’</h3>
      <p>
        In our own universe, it would serve as a window into the forces
        operating at energies forever beyond the reach of particle accelerators
        on Earth and yield new insights into gravity itself. Dr. Kovac’s ripples
        would be the first direct observation of gravitational waves, which,
        according to Einstein’s theory of general relativity, should ruffle
        space-time.<br />

        Marc Kamionkowski of Johns Hopkins University, an early-universe expert
        who was not part of the team, said, “This is huge, as big as it
        gets.”<br />

        He continued, “This is a signal from the very earliest universe, sending
        a telegram encoded in gravitational waves.”<br />

        The ripples manifested themselves as faint spiral patterns in a bath of
        microwave radiation that permeates space and preserves a picture of the
        universe when it was 380,000 years old and as hot as the surface of the
        sun.<br />

        Dr. Kovac and his collaborators, working in an experiment known as
        Bicep, for Background Imaging of Cosmic Extragalactic Polarization,
        reported their results in a scientific briefing at the Center for

      <h3>The Theory of Inflation</h3>
      <p>
        Astronomers have found evidence to support the theory of inflation,
        which explains how the universe expanded so uniformly and so quickly in
        the instant after the Big Bang 13.8 billion years ago.

        Dr. Kovac said the chance that the results were a fluke was only one in
        10 million. Dr. Guth, now 67, pronounced himself “bowled over,” saying
        he had not expected such a definite confirmation in his lifetime.
      </p>
      <p>
        “With nature, you have to be lucky,” he said. “Apparently we have been
        lucky.”<br />

        The results are the closely guarded distillation of three years’ worth
        of observations and analysis. Eschewing email for fear of a leak, Dr.
        Kovac personally delivered drafts of his work to a select few, meeting
        with Dr. Guth, who is now a professor at Massachusetts Institute of
        Technology (as is his son, Larry, who was sleeping that night in 1979),
        in his office last week.<br />

        “It was a very special moment, and one we took very seriously as
        scientists,” said Dr. Kovac, who chose his words as carefully as he
        tended his radio telescopes.<br />

        Andrei Linde of Stanford, a prolific theorist who first described the
        most popular variant of inflation, known as chaotic inflation, in 1983,
        was about to go on vacation in the Caribbean last week when Chao-Lin
        Kuo, a Stanford colleague and a member of Dr. Kovac’s team,
        <a href="#">knocked on his door with a bottle of Champagne</a> to tell
        him the news.

      <p>
        Confused, Dr. Linde called out to his wife, asking if she had ordered
        anything.<br />

        “And then I told him that in the beginning we thought that this was a
        delivery but we did not think that we ordered anything, but I simply
        forgot that actually I did order it, 30 years ago,” Dr. Linde wrote in
        an email.<br />

        Calling from Bonaire, the Dutch Caribbean island, Dr. Linde said he was
        still hyperventilating. “Having news like this is the best way of
        spoiling a vacation,” he said.<br />

        By last weekend, as social media was buzzing with rumors that inflation
        had been seen and news spread, astrophysicists responded with a mixture
        of jubilation and caution.
      </p>
      <p>
        Max Tegmark, a cosmologist at M.I.T., wrote in an email, “I think that
        if this stays true, it will go down as one of the greatest discoveries
        in the history of science.”<br />

        John E. Carlstrom of the University of Chicago, Dr. Kovac’s mentor and
        head of a competing project called the South Pole Telescope, pronounced
        himself deeply impressed. “I think the results are beautiful and very
        convincing,” he said.<br />

        Paul J. Steinhardt of Princeton, author of a competitor to inflation
        that posits the clash of a pair of universes as the cause of genesis,
        said that if true, the Bicep result would eliminate his model, but he
        expressed reservations about inflation.<br />

        Lawrence M. Krauss of Arizona State and others also emphasized the need
        for confirmation, noting that the new results exceeded earlier estimates
        based on temperature maps of the cosmic background by the European Space
        Agency’s Planck satellite and other assumptions about the universe.<br />

        “So we will need to wait and see before we jump up and down,” Dr. Krauss
        said.<br />

        Corroboration might not be long in coming. The Planck spacecraft will
        report its own findings this year. At least a dozen other teams are
        trying similar measurements from balloons, mountaintops and space.<br />

      <h3>Spirals in the Sky</h3>
      <p>
        Gravity waves are the latest and deepest secret yet pried out of the
        cosmic microwaves, which were discovered accidentally by Arno Penzias
        and Robert Wilson at Bell Labs 50 years ago. They won the Nobel
        Prize.<br />

        Dr. Kovac has spent his career trying to read the secrets of these
        waves. He is one of four leaders of Bicep, which has operated a series
        of increasingly sensitive radio telescopes at the South Pole, where the
        thin, dry air creates ideal observing conditions. The others are Clement
        Pryke of the University of Minnesota, Jamie Bock of the California
        Institute of Technology and Dr. Kuo of Stanford.
      </p>

      <p>
        “The South Pole is the closest you can get to space and still be on the
        ground,” Dr. Kovac said. He has been there 23 times, he said, wintering
        over in 1994. “I’ve been hooked ever since,” he said.

        The Bicep2 telescope, in the foreground, was used to detect the faint
        spiraling gravity patterns — the signature of a universe being wrenched
        violently apart at its birth.<span class="credit"

        In 2002, he was part of a team that discovered that the microwave
        radiation was polarized, meaning the light waves had a slight preference
        to vibrate in one direction rather than another.<br />

        This was a step toward the ultimate goal of detecting the gravitational
        waves from inflation. Such waves, squeezing space in one direction and
        stretching it in another as they go by, would twist the direction of
        polarization of the microwaves, theorists said. As a result, maps of the
        polarization in the sky should have little arrows going in spirals.<br />

        Detecting those spirals required measuring infinitesimally small
        differences in the temperature of the microwaves. The group’s telescope,
        Bicep2, is basically a giant superconducting thermometer.<br />

        “We had no expectations what we would see,” Dr. Kovac said.<br />

        The strength of the signal surprised the researchers, and they spent a
        year burning up time on a Harvard supercomputer, making sure they had
        things right and worrying that competitors might beat them to the
        breakthrough.
      </p>
      <h3 class="special">A Special Time</h3>
      <p>
        The data traced the onset of inflation to a time that physicists like
        Dr. Guth, staying up late in his Palo Alto house 35 years ago, suspected
        was a special break point in the evolution of the universe.<br />

        Physicists recognize four forces at work in the world today: gravity,
        electromagnetism, and strong and weak nuclear forces. But they have long
        suspected that those are simply different manifestations of a single
        unified force that ruled the universe in its earliest, hottest
        moments.<br />

        As the universe cooled, according to this theory, there was a fall from
        grace, like some old folk mythology of gods or brothers falling out with
        each other. The laws of physics evolved, with one force after another
        splitting away.<br />

        That was where Dr. Guth came in.<br />

        Under some circumstances, a glass of water can stay liquid as the
        temperature falls below 32 degrees, until it is disturbed, at which
        point it will rapidly freeze, releasing latent heat.<br />

        Similarly, the universe could “supercool” and stay in a unified state
        too long. In that case, space itself would become imbued with a
        mysterious latent energy. Inserted into Einstein’s equations, the latent
        energy would act as a kind of antigravity, and the universe would blow
        itself up. Since it was space itself supplying the repulsive force, the
        more space was created, the harder it pushed apart.<br />

        What would become our observable universe mushroomed in size at least a
        trillion trillionfold — from a submicroscopic speck of primordial energy
        to the size of a grapefruit — in less than a cosmic eye-blink.<br />

        Almost as quickly, this pulse would subside, relaxing into ordinary
        particles and radiation. All of normal cosmic history was still ahead,
        resulting in today’s observable universe, a patch of sky and stars
        billions of light-years across. “It’s often said that there is no such
        thing as a free lunch,” Dr. Guth likes to say, “but the universe might
        be the ultimate free lunch.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Make that free lunches. Most of the hundred or so models resulting from
        Dr. Guth’s original vision suggest that inflation, once started, is
        eternal. Even as our own universe settled down to a comfortable homey
        expansion, the rest of the cosmos will continue blowing up, spinning off
        other bubbles endlessly, a concept known as the multiverse.<br />

        So the future of the cosmos is perhaps bright and fecund, but do not
        bother asking about going any deeper into the past.<br />

        We might never know what happened before inflation, at the very
        beginning, because inflation erases everything that came before it. All
        the chaos and randomness of the primordial moment are swept away,
        forever out of our view.<br />

        “If you trace your cosmic roots,” said Abraham Loeb, a
        Harvard-Smithsonian astronomer who was not part of the team, “you wind
        up at inflation.”
